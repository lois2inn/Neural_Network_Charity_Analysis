# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis

Beks is a data scientist for non profit foundation Alphabet Soup, which is dedicated to help organizations that protect the environment and improve overall people well being. Her job is to analyze the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients. This helps ensure that the foundation’s money is being used effectively. Because every donation the company makes is not impactful, the project aims to help Beks **predict which organizations are worth donating to and which are high risk**. Since this problem is too complex for the statistical and machine learning models used, deep learning neural network will be designed and trained. The datasource is a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The below tasks will be achieved:
- Explore and implement neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python.
- Preprocess Data for a Neural Network Model.
- Create a binary classification model that can predict if a funded organization will be successful based on the features in the dataset.
- Compile, train, and evaluate the binary classification model to calculate the model’s loss and accuracy.
- Optimize the Model in order to achieve a target predictive accuracy higher than 75%.
- Store and retrieve trained models for more robust uses.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?


## Summary

- Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. 
- Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.
